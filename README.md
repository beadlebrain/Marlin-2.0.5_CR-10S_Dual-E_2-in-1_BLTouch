# Marlin-2.0.5_CR-10S_Dual-E_2-in-1_BLTouch
i uploaded this to my (stock) creality dual extruder board v2.2 with the arduino pro alpha ide which can be found here. https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/10/18/arduino-pro-ide-alpha-preview-with-advanced-features/
ive attached my entire project and it appears that ifd you open the marlin 2.0x folder then it will only load the relevant files in the explorer on the left hand page like,
you would see in vs studio code. but much more simplified for people like myself.
